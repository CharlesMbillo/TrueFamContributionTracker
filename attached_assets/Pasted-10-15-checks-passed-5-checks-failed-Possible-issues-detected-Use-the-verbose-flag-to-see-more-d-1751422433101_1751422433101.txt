✖ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Error validating fields in /home/runner/workspace/app.json:
 should NOT have additional property 'displayName'.
Advice:
Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/

✖ Check for issues with Metro config
It looks like that you are using a custom metro.config.js that does not extend @expo/metro-config. This can lead to unexpected and hard to debug issues. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/customizing-metro/
Advice:
Update your metro.config.js to extend @expo/metro-config.

✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: android, ios. 

Advice:
Add '/android' and '/ios' to your .gitignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build

✖ Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  Untested on New Architecture: react-native-push-notification
  Unmaintained: react-native-push-notification
  No metadata available: @react-native/new-app-screen, react-native-get-sms-android
Advice:
Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.

✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  react@19.1.0 - expected version: 19.0.0
  react-native@0.80.0 - expected version: 0.79.4
  @types/react@19.1.0 - expected version: ~19.0.10
Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.
Found outdated dependencies
Advice:
Use 'npx expo install --check' to review and upgrade your dependencies.
